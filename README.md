### `Inspiration:`
For my senior design project, I am going to be using React.js to create a game. I thought in order to learn how to use the language better I could take a crack at something I always wanted to do: a dating sim! I mean who hasn't thought of dating their favorite coding language.

### `What I Learned:`
One thing I really learned is how complicated React and Javascript can get when building games or complete programs like this. Most would say to screw web applications and just make games using Unity. However, I do not back down so easily! While a little complicated, it is possible. Each page can be rendered as a component and upon button clicks you can render a different component.

### `Languages:`
For this project I used React.js and Javascript to create the entire game. I had help from multiple libraries in React for sound and visuals including: react-sound and reactDOM.

### `Challenges:`
There were many challenges I faced while building this code for this project. A big challenge I faced in the beginning was click events on the buttons rendering new components. This was later solved using the ReactDOM library.  I had major problems throughout the project of styling with the CSS and having them all follow a similar style pattern. Which was fixed through meticulously setting properties. 

### `How to improve in the future:`
I would like to fix up the visuals and the bugs concerning the choice buttons affecting the background. The button styling in general needs to be worked on. I would also like to flesh out the story more and add more languages if possible. I would also like to mess with react-sound more and have the songs loop on each page. As well as add animations.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
